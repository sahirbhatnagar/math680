# math680

I've broken the code down into sections.

I'm also using `knitr` to for the report. Take note of how I include code into the `.Rnw` document. 
The `Rscript` must be correctly commented for the Sweave document to read in the proper code chunks.

See [code externalizations](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/externalization/) for details.

Also see [Section 3.4 of knitr manual](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/manual/)

transform: phi inverse ((i-0.5)/n)

y95 = cholost$y[95]+45
